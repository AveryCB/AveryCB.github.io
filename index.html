                <p class="font">The individual game project was a game that I had full creative control over and is the
                    culmination of the skills I have so far learned in GIMM. What made the project fun was coming up
                    with things to implement in the game. </p>

                <p class="font"> I have edited numerous videos in KdenLive for portfolios at the end of a project and
                    360 videos that were implemented in unity.
                    What I Learned was how to use Kdenlive to edit videos.
